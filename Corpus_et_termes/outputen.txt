The Green Edge initiative was developed to investigate the processes controlling the primary productivity and the fate of organic matter produced during the Arctic phytoplankton spring bloom (PSB) and to determine its role in the ecosystem. Two field campaigns were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at an ice camp located on landfast sea ice southeast of Qikiqtarjuaq Island in Baffin Bay (67.4797N, 63.7895W). During both expeditions, a large suite of physical, chemical and biological variables was measured beneath a consolidated sea ice cover from the surface to the bottom at 360 m depth to better understand the factors driving the PSB. Key variables such as temperature, salinity, radiance, irradiance, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll- concentration, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and taxonomy, carbon stocks and fluxes were routinely measured at the ice camp. Here, we present the results of a joint effort to tidy and standardize the collected data sets that will facilitate their reuse in other Arctic studies.

The In Situ Analysis System (ISAS) was developed to produce gridded fields of temperature and salinity that preserve as much as possible the time and space sampling capabilities of the Argo network of profiling floats. The ISAS-SSS configuration provide Sea Surface Salinity gridded fields from in-situ measurements including Argo, Moorings, Marine Mammals, GOSUD Thermosalinometer SSS measurements from delayed mode SNO-SSS merchant ships (

The MALINA oceanographic campaign was conducted during summer 2009 to investigate the carbon stocks and the processes controlling the carbon fluxes in the Mackenzie River estuary and the Beaufort Sea. During the campaign, an extensive suite of physical, chemical and biological variables was measured across seven shelf–basin transects (south-north) to capture the meridional gradient between the estuary and the open ocean. Key variables such as temperature, absolute salinity, radiance, irradiance, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a concentration, bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and taxonomy, and carbon stocks and fluxes were routinely measured onboard the Canadian research icebreaker CCGS Amundsen and from a barge in shallow coastal areas or for sampling within broken ice fields. This dataset is the results of a joint effort to tidy and standardize the collected data sets that will facilitate their reuse in further studies of the changing Arctic Ocean.

Mean subthermocline and intermediate zonal currents meridional sections are produced at several longitudes across the Tropical Pacific, from 18°S to 18°N and 0 to 2000m depth. They are based on a compilation of shipboard ADCP measurements, and absolute geostrophic velocities constructed from a high-resolution 0–2000-m Argo climatology referenced to a 1000-m velocity field derived from Argo float drifts.
Description
1) SADCP data obtained from ships transiting in the low-latitude tropical Pacific, during 1999–2015 (see Cravatte et al., 2017, 190 cruises) are compiled. Most of the data (128 cruises) were provided by the Joint Archive for Shipboard ADCP (JASADCP) at the University of Hawaii, with a large fraction from the NOAA ship Ka’imimoana, servicing the TAO array of moored buoys.
All data retrieved from the JASADCP center were from their ‘‘standard subset’’ containing hourly averages interpolated to a 10-m vertical grid. For the other datasets, SADCP data were provided as 5- to 15-min temporal averages with 5- to 24-m vertical resolution. They were then averaged and interpolated to the 1-h, 10-m vertical grid. The complete dataset was mapped on a 0.25° latitude by 1° longitude grid using a simple Gaussian weighting function with 0.25° latitude and 3° longitude decorrelation scales, independent of the timing of the measurements, with windows of 0.5° of latitude and 6° of longitude.
2) The mean Argo temperature and salinity gridded climatology with a 1/6° resolution (Roemmich and Gilson 2009 was used to compute dynamic height anomalies. Derived zonal geostrophic shear both on and off the equator were computed following the method presented by Picaut and Tournier (1991) using a 1000-m reference level. The 1000-m Argo float drift then provided the constant of integration for vertically integrating the geostrophic shear to obtain a field of mean absolute geostrophic velocity.

Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) is an essential climate variable that requires long term in situ observation. The French SSS Observation Service (SSS-OS) manages a network of Voluntary Observing Ships equipped with thermosalinographs (TSG) since 2002. The network is global though more concentrated in the tropical Pacific and North Atlantic oceanic basins. The acquisition system is autonomous with real time transmission and is regularly serviced at harbor calls. The high resolution data retrieved from the acquisition system during ship calls is processed through a dedicated software (freely available) for attribution of data quality flags by visual inspection, and correction of TSG time series by comparison with climatology, onboard daily water samples and collocated Argo data. Details can be found in the reference below. The validated delayed time data collected from TSG, together with some bucket samples mostly collected before 2002, are made available for educational and research purposes through an interactive web interface.

Gridded XBT temperature sections from the SURVOSTRAL project  provide a unique multi-decadal observational dataset of temperature across the Southern Ocean from Hobart (Tasmania, 42.9°S, 147.3°E) to Dumont d’Urville (Adelie Land, 66.6°S, 140.0°E), starting in 1992.  Gridded temperature sections are based on XBT temperature profiles collected each year during the summer heating cycle from early spring (Oct/Nov) to autumn (Mar), over the depth range from the surface down to 900 m.
XBT data were collected aboard the French supply vessel L’Astrolabe, with the support of the French Institut Polaire Emile Victor (IPEV), the LEGOS research laboratory, the CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research division. and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

                This XBT section is part of the SOP (Ships of Opportunity) network and CLIVAR, and is referred to as section IX28 (
                https://doi.org/10.18142/172
                ).
              
The dataset consists of 25 years (November 1992 to February 2017) of 10238 expendable bathythermograph (XBT) profiles on this section between Hobart, Australia and Dumont d’Urville, Antarctica. Measurements are collected from an average of six transects per year between late October and early March.

                Depending on ice and weather conditions, XBT measurements are sampled every 35km, with a finer 18km sampling across the energetic polar frontal region from 49°S to 54°S. Temperature profiles extend down to 900 meters depth with a vertical resolution of about 0.7 meters. The XBT temperature profile accuracy is +/-0.1°C. XBT profiles have been corrected for temperature and depth biases depending on the probe type. All corrected XBT measurements can be retrieved from the IMOS website (
                http://thredds.aodn.org.au/thredds/catalog/IMOS/SOOP/SOOP-XBT/DELAYED/Line_IX28_Dumont-d-Urville-Hobart/catalog.html).

Individual XBT profiles are then mapped onto a regular meridional-vertical section from North to South, following the mean path of the Astrolabe’s transect, with 0.5° resolution in latitude (increasing to 0.25° in the polar frontal zone from 49-54°S), with 2m depth resolution down to 800 m depth. XBT profiles sampled further than 3° in longitude from the mean path of the Astrolabe are removed from the analysis.
Different types of gridded products are available :
1)    Climatological monthly mean temperature sections are calculated for each month during the austral summer ONDJFM period and averaged over 25 years (6 monthly mean temperature sections).
2)    Austral summer (NDJF) mean temperature sections are constructed for each year from 1993 to 2017, allowing us to track the interannual temperature evolution (25 annual summer mean temperature sections).
3) Temperature values and anomalies measured for each profile of SURVOSTRAL program, gridded on mean path. Temperature anomaly profiles are constructed by subtracting the climatological monthly mean temperature value at each latitude and depth from each XBT profile. For detalis, see Auger et al. 2021.
